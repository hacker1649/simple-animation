# simple_animation

A new Flutter project.

We can enhance our flutter applications with stunning rive animations, bringing life and interactivity to our UI.

We simply executed the example (basic example playing a rive animation from a packaged asset) provided in the Rive GitHub repository. An additional feature we incorporated into this example is the presence of the animation within a sized box widget with dimensions of 200 in height and width.
